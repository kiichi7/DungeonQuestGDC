OK: finish final game UI
OK: effect system
OK: cave + collision

day 2

day 3:
OK: final game logic
OK: finetuning
OK: implement sound
OK: quests

day 4:

bugs:
OK: improved performance a lot by optimizing some internal code and using all ps3.0 shaders now (sad thing is it only runs with ps3.0 hardware now)
TIPP: If you have a low spec ps3.0 graphic card (like the GeForce 6600 or lower) use a smaller resolution, the game will run much faster. Use the DungeonQuestSettings.xml file and enter a smaller resolution there (e.g. 800x600). The game is heavily GPU bound (like all my games) and it pushes several million polygons each frame (scene alone has almost a million polygons, but it has to be rendered 3 times for all shadow mapping and post processing effects). Runs on XBox 360 or GeForce 7x hardware very good with 100fps and more.
OK: fixed parallax mapping for the cave and improved the specular effects, looks much nicer now. Also increased view distance and light affect range.
OK: improved the music and sound effects, also added a lot more events
OK: added many text messages to help the player understand the game better
OK: check if computer can do ps 2.a, else abort!
	OK: Actually everything now requires ps3.0 and is tested on those systems,
		it was hard to make it run on the many different ps2.0, ps2.a, ps2.b
		configurations and many problems came from that.
OK: support 64bit systems
OK: reduced glow in post screen
OK: fixed game logic and quests
OK: all game actions get a nice message now in the center
	(killed ogre, got key, quest complete, new weapon, etc.)
OK: implemented several new animations for hitting and dying
OK: fixed text size in 3:4 resolutions (did only look correct in 16:9
OK: improved gravity (much stronger now) and fixed several collision bugs
OK: collecting key (show in ui)
	OK: also allow dropping weapons
	OK: text when selecting stuff from ground
		OK: also when changing weapons, leveling up, etc.
		OK: make font display stuff + fadeout for that!
	OK: allow switching weapons (right/left shoulder buttons)
	OK: text for weapon
	OK: collecting key/weapon needs testing!
OK: selected enemy ring (we forgot about that)
OK: rumble when hit/getting hit
OK: end screen (book link, credits, highscores?)
	OK: allow exiting with back/esc, then show endscreen
	OK: still show game in background (darken down?)
ok: collision 2 rays
ok: gravity*2
ok: waffen
ok: fireball
ok: rename classes
ok: text
OK: show highscore list when game over
OK: mouse support for dungeon quest (shooter like, just asdw for moving)
OK: check all sounds, improve music (make louder)
OK: block door when we don't got key!
OK: sphere collision for monsters
OK: make check if player or monster is below level, then fix! both
	player and monster still disappear to often below surface :(
OK: xbox support
OK: shadows (at end)

OK: zuckel gravity error
OK: fix gravitation
OK: monster rotate error 360 degrees
OK: autoselect sword if found new better weapon
OK: wizard fire like player and throw from helper
OK: gelb enemy ring effect
OK: icon
OK: need some grunt sounds, ambient stuff, etc. very boring else!

OK: fix move bug when in end screen
OK: remove shift shadow map

Release TODOs:
OK: code cleanup
OK: check all unit tests, improve code a little, add comments
OK: test ps2.0 configuration!
OK: test with Xbox 360 controller, the Xbox 360 itself and TV monitor support!
OK: make game a little bit easier, far too hard for some people
OK: installer, source code, test and release it!

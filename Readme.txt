This is the Dungeon Quest game made for the XNA Contest live on the GDC 2007.
The full game, including all textures, 3d models, sounds and source code was
made in just 4 days directly on the GDC in the lobby (man, that was loud).
Some of the engine code is based on previously released XNA code from me
(mostly the XNA Rocket Commander game engine and the Collada Model Loader).

The game is a very much simplified example on how to create an action rpg game
with XNA. Maybe I will extend the idea some day, for now it only got a very
simple rpg level system and some simple weapons plus 4-5 different enemies.

You can find the latest version on:

Feel free to use this code in your projects, see Licence.txt for more details.
